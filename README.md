# Labrary

This project is a Porosity of Electrode Calculator built with Next.js 15 using the T3 Stack. It helps users quickly input and calculate electrode parameters like thickness, mass, dimensions, and material fractions. The app uses Zustand for state management, React Hook Form for handling forms, and Zod for input validation. Clean, reusable UI components are built with ShadCN and Tailwind CSS.
